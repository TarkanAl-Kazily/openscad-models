# My OpenSCAD models

This repository contains my OpenSCAD work for fun and learning, and features a variety of model designs.

All models are located under the 'models' directory, loosely organized based on project area. As I build up common utilities, I plan to place those in a seperate 'lib' directory. If it makes sense, I'll upload an STL of models so that they can be visualized from within Github directly.

I won't be accepting contributions from others here unless I'm directly collaborating with a person on a design.

## What is OpenSCAD?

OpenSCAD is a 3D parametric CAD program that uses scripting to define your parts. Visit [openscad.org](https://openscad.org/) for more information.
